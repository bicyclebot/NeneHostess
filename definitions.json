"infotext":"I'm a bot coded by aren | enragedbicycle and Ai0 from the Melt Room Emporium (https://discord.gg/meltroomemporium)!\nMy purpose is to coordinate Cheerful Shows between MRE's large player base and smaller, dedicated tiering communities that may be struggling to find matches.\nWe do this by broadcasting when MRE players are about to begin a Cheerful Live, what team they're on, and if they're in a General Room or a Pro Room (as well as if those in General Rooms have high BP or not).\nPlease DM `@aren#4309` from MRE if you have any questions that are not answered by our `!help` messsages.",

"helpadmintext": "Have someone **with administrator permissions* make two new channels and then use /n— `!setchannelx` in one\nand\n— '!setchannely` in the other.\nChannel X will receive notifications from the team on the left side of the in-game CC selection screen, and Channel Y will receive notifications from the team on the right (label them however works best for your community).\nIt is recommended that **at least one administrator:**\n— Joins MRE (<https://discord.gg/meltroomemporium>)\n— Goes to the #resources channel under the `PSEKAI INFO` category\n— Gets the `@NeneHostess PSAs` role in case **an update or emergency happens** that requires you to change settings in your server, reset your X and Y channels, or any commands get added or removed\n— Takes note that Server Rule 11 does not apply to aren when it comes to NeneHostess, so their DMs and the #questions channel can be used for troubleshooting."
